BddSet
======

BDD-based integer set representation.

This is not a BDD library. This is an efficient set representation when there
exist a lot of redundant and overlapping sets. The idea is derived from a paper
(Efficient Forward Computation of Dynamic Slices Using Reduced Ordered Binary
Decision Diagrams) by Zhang *et al*.

Installation
------------

  * ./configure --prefix=*path*
  * make
